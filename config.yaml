# Configuration for the lift simulation.  These values define the
# dimensions of the field, floors, lift, door speed, and lamp radius.
# The ``k`` multiplier scales all linear dimensions and speeds.  To change
# the overall scale of the scene, adjust only ``k`` – all other
# dimensions will be multiplied by it at runtime.

# Global scale factor.  All lengths and speeds below are multiplied by this.
k: 2

# Field dimensions (in base units).  Will be multiplied by k.
field:
  width: 400
  height: 600

# Number of floors in the building.
num_floors: 3

# Dimensions of a single floor (in base units).
floor_height: 100
floor_spacing: 50

# Lift (cabin) dimensions (in base units).
lift:
  width: 60
  height: 80

# Movement speeds for the lift (in base units per tick).  Speeds
# are scaled by k.
speeds:
  normal: 2
  slow: 1

# Door opening speed (dimensionless fraction per tick).  This value is
# independent of k because it represents a fraction of the door's travel.
door_speed_norm: 0.03

# Radius of the indicator lamps (in base units).  Will be multiplied by k.
lamp_radius: 10
